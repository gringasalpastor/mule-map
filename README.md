# `MuleMap<🫏,🗺>`

`MuleMap` is a hybrid between a `HashMap` and a lookup table. Use `MuleMap` when the majority of your map accesses use keys that are near a fixed point `n` (by default we assume for keys near 0). `MuleMap` tries to match the API of the standard library `HashMap` (where possible) - making it mostly a drop in replacement for `HashMap`. 

## Example


```rust
use MuleMap;

type Hash = fnv_rs::FnvBuildHasher;  // Use whatever hash function you prefer
let mut mule_map = MuleMap::<u32, usize, Hash>::new();

assert_eq!(mule_map.get(5), None);
let entry = mule_map.entry(5);
entry.or_insert(10);
assert_eq!(mule_map.get(5), Some(&10));
```

## Limitations

 - Only supports keys that are primitive integer types (`u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, ~~`usize`~~, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, and ~~`isize`~~). Non-primitive keys could be added if demand is seen, otherwise not likely.
 - Does not support automatically converting enum's with primitive representations. Likely to be added in the future. 
 - Currently the type of a const generic can't depend on another generic type argument, so `TABLE_MIN_VALUE` and `TABLE_MAX_VALUE` can't use the same type as the key. Because of this, I am using `i128`, but that means we can't represent values near `u128::MAX`. Hopefully having frequent keys near `u128::MAX` is extremely rare.
 - Currently requires `std`, but if there is demand it would not be hard to make `no_std`.
